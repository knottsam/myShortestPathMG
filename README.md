# myShortestPathMG

This project demonstrates a simple grid of tiles using MonoGame.

## How to add your tile texture
1. Place your texture file in the `Content` directory and add it to `Content.mgcb`.
2. Replace the `TileTextureName` constant in `Game1.cs` with your asset name (without the extension).
3. Build the content and run the project.
